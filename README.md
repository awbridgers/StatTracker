### How it works
1. Select which team and which program you want to parse by using the sliders at the bottom of the screen.
2. To start, add players to the roster by pressing *Edit Roster*. The players should be added in the format: **# First Last**. (eg: 21 Tim Duncan)
3. Press *Save Roster* to save the roster to your computer.
4. Select the starters from your team using the dropdown bars.
5. You can save the starters for next time by pressing *Save Starters*. This will save you from having to enter the starters each time you open the app. 
6. Enter the play by play data from each half or period into the text box. If you are using *LiveStats*, copy everything from the first play to ***END OF PERIOD*** or ***END OF GAME***. If you are using *SideArm* copy all the plays and then **manually enter *END OF PERIOD* or *END OF GAME* onto the next line**. 
7. Press *Submit* to get a spreadsheet of stats for each lineup that played inthe game
